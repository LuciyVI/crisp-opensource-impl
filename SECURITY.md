# Security Policy

## Reporting vulnerabilities

Please report suspected vulnerabilities privately to project maintainers.
Do not open public issues for exploitable security flaws before triage.

## Supported components

This repository currently provides a protocol-core skeleton and test-only crypto stub.
It is not production-ready yet.

## Notes

- `dummy_crypto_backend` is strictly for tests and must never be used in production.
- Security-hardening tasks are tracked in `docs/roadmap.md`.
